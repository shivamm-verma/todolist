# todolist
I've built a straightforward To-Do List project using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's an easy-to-use tool for managing tasks. You can add or delete complete tasks seamlessly. The design adapts to different screens, and I welcome contributions to make it even better. Let's make task management a breeze!
